            obrigado ends with -o)

  utter_lesson1_personalPronouns:
    - text: "The first grammatical content I will teach you are personal pronouns. 
             Here's a simple table showing the correspondence between both languages:
             Eu - I
             Tu - You (familiar singular)
             Você - You (informal singular)
             Ele - He
             Ela - She
             Nós - We
             Vocês - You (familiar plural)
             Eles - They (masculine)
             Elas - They (feminine)
             
             Notes:
             In portuguese it is common to omit the personal pronouns EU, TU and NÓS as the ending of the verb is enough
             to tell who is performing the described action.
             
             The pronoun TU is used among relatives, children and people of similar age. 
             For more informal conversations (eg. in the workplace, between student - teacher)
             the pronoun VOCÊ is more adequate.
             
             The plural of both pronouns above discussed is VOCÊS."

  utter_lesson2_askingQuestions:
    - text: "Usually questions are asked simply by changing the intonation of the sentence, and adding a question mark
             at the end, resulting in a yes or no question.
             
             Você quer mais vinho? = Do you want more wine? -> this question can be answered with a simple:
              Sim = Yes
              Não = No
              
            Open-ended questions make use of question words:
              - Quem? = Who? (eg. Quem és tu? = Who are you?) 
              - Quanto? = How much? (eg. Quantos (the key question word is in the plural form because the noun that
                follows the question word is also in the plural form) anos tens? = How old are you?)
              - Qual? = Which? (eg. Qual (Quais - plural form) queres? = Which one do you want?) 
              - Porquê? = Why? (eg. Porque (this word loses the accent if the question is more specific)
                estás triste? = Why are you sad?)
              - Quando? = When? (eg. Quando fazes anos? = When is your birthday?)
              - Onde? = Where? (eg. Onde moras? = Where do you live?)
              - Como? = How? (eg. Como estás? = How are you?)
              - Quê? = What? (eg. O quê? (It is common for the article O to precede the pronoun QUE 
                but not mandatory.) = What? / O que (When the question does not ends with QUE, the pronoun
                 loses the accent.) estás a fazer? = What are you doing? / Que dia é hoje? = What day is it today?)
