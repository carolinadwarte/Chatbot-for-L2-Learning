  utter_lesson1_personalPronouns:
    - text: "The first gramatical content I will teach you are personal pronouns. 
             Here's a simple table showing the correspondence between both languages:
             Eu - I
             Tu - You (familiar singular)
             Você - You (informal singular)
             Ele - He
             Ela - She
             Nós - We
             Vocês - You (familiar plural)
             Eles - They (masculine)
             Elas - They (feminine)
             
             Notes:
             The pronoun TU is used among relatives, children and people of similar age. 
             For more informal conversations (eg. in the workplace, between student - teacher)
             the pronoun VOCÊ is more adequate.
             
             The plural of both pronouns above discussed is VOCÊS."
